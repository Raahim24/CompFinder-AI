What This Notebook Does
This is a feature engineering notebook that prepares data for a machine learning model. Let me break it down:
1. The Data Context
The notebook works with three datasets related to real estate:

Subjects (88 records): Properties being appraised
Comps (264 records): Comparable properties that were already selected as comparables
Candidates (9,820 records): Potential comparable properties to evaluate

2. The Goal
The goal appears to be building a model that can predict which candidate properties would make good comparables for a subject property during real estate appraisal.
3. Feature Engineering Process
The notebook creates pairwise features by comparing each subject property with its comps/candidates:
Numerical Differences:

gla_diff: Difference in Gross Living Area (square footage)
lot_size_diff: Difference in lot size
bedroom_diff: Difference in number of bedrooms
bathroom_diff: Difference in number of bathrooms
room_count_diff: Difference in total room count

Categorical Matches:

same_property_type: Whether properties are same type (Detached, Townhouse, etc.)
same_storey_type: Whether properties have same number of stories

Temporal Features:

sold_recently_90: Whether property sold within 90 days of subject's effective date
sold_recently_180: Whether property sold within 180 days

4. Output
Two model-ready datasets are created:

comp_pair_model_ready.csv: Subject-comp pairs (positive examples)
candidates_pair_model_ready.csv: Subject-candidate pairs (to be classified)
