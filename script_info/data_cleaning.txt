Detailed Analysis of Your Data Cleaning Project
Project Overview
You're building a Property Appraisal Comp Recommendation System. This system appears to be designed to find comparable properties (comps) for real estate appraisals by matching subject properties with similar properties from a candidate pool.
Data Structure
You're working with three datasets:

Subjects (88 records) - Properties being appraised
Comps (264 records) - Known comparable properties
Candidates (9,820 records) - Pool of potential comparable properties

What You've Accomplished
1. Data Exploration Framework (Cells 3-7)
You created a summarize_selected_unique_features() function that:

Examines specific columns in each dataset
Shows all unique values and counts
Helps identify data quality issues and inconsistencies
Handles missing columns gracefully

This is crucial for understanding the messy real-world data you're dealing with.
2. Date Standardization
The clean_date() function handles multiple date formats:

Converts formats like "Apr/11/2025" and "2025-01-13" to standard "YYYY-MM-DD"
Uses dateutil parser for flexibility
Returns None for invalid/missing dates
Essential for temporal comparisons in property matching

3. Area/Size Standardization
The clean_numeric_with_units() function is sophisticated:

Handles multiple formats: "1500 SqFt", "78 SqM", "1.25 Acres"
Processes dimension strings: "49' x 119'"
Handles hybrid formats: "50' x 118' / 5,900 sf"
Converts everything to square feet for consistency
Smart logic: prefers explicit area over calculated dimensions

4. Room Count Cleaning
The clean_room_count() function:

Handles composite counts like "6+3" (main rooms + bonus)
Converts to simple float values
Manages missing/NA values

5. Bathroom Count Standardization
The clean_bathroom_count() function handles complex bathroom notations:

"2:1" format (full:half)
"2F 1H" format
"2 Full/1Half" format
Converts half baths to 0.5 for numerical consistency

6. Distance Cleaning
Simple but necessary clean_distance() function:

Extracts numeric values from "0.15 KM" format
Standardizes to kilometers

7. Property Type Standardization
This is one of your most complex cleaning operations:

Manual mapping dictionary with fuzzy matching capability
Canonical types list defining 9 standard property types
standardize_property_type() function that:

Combines property_sub_type and structure_type fields
Uses fuzzy matching for typos
Falls back to keyword detection
Ensures only canonical types are returned



8. Story/Style Standardization
Similar approach for building stories:

STORY_GROUPS defining 10 standard styles
STOREY_MAP for mapping variations
clean_story_group() for subjects/comps
standardize_candidate_storey() specifically for candidates

Key Design Decisions & Reasoning

Fuzzy Matching: You're using RapidFuzz for string matching, which is smart because real estate data often has typos and variations.
Canonical Lists: By defining strict canonical types, you ensure consistency across all datasets, which is crucial for accurate property matching.
Fallback Logic: Multiple layers of matching (exact → fuzzy → substring → keyword) ensure maximum data retention while maintaining quality.
None Returns: Consistently returning None for unmatchable values allows you to handle missing data explicitly rather than forcing bad matches.
Unit Standardization: Converting all areas to square feet and distances to kilometers eliminates unit confusion in comparisons.
